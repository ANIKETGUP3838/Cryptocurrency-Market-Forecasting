# AI Fact-Checking Web App

A deployed web application that automatically extracts factual claims from a PDF
and verifies them against **live web data**.

This app is designed to be **robust, production-safe**, and resilient to real-world
API limitations such as OpenAI quota exhaustion.

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to build a **fact-checking layer** that sits between
content drafts and publishing. The system identifies factual claims and checks
their accuracy using **real-time web search**.

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1️⃣ Claim Extraction
- The app extracts factual claims (numbers, dates, statistics) from an uploaded PDF.
- **Primary method:** OpenAI LLM (when available)
- **Fallback method:** Regex-based extraction when LLM quota is exhausted

### 2️⃣ Live Verification
- Claims are verified using **Tavily Web Search API**
- The app analyzes live search results to classify each claim as:
  - **Verified**
  - **Inaccurate**
  - **False**

### 3️⃣ Reporting
For every claim, the app displays:
- Verification status
- Short explanation
- Live web sources used

## 🛡️ API Quota Handling (Important)

This app is intentionally built to **degrade gracefully** under API limitations.

### If OpenAI quota is available:
- LLM-based claim extraction is used
- Tavily is used for live verification

### If OpenAI quota is exhausted:
- The app switches to **regex-based claim extraction**
- **Live web verification continues using Tavily**
- The app does **not crash** and remains fully testable

This design reflects real-world production reliability and ensures uninterrupted evaluation.
